# Smart Analysis - DISABLED

## Status: DISABLED âœ…

**Smart Analysis has been disabled to conserve trial API calls.**

## What's Disabled

1. **`startup_smart_analysis.sh`** - Daily automated startup script
2. **`run_daily_smart_analysis.py`** - Python script with safety check

## How to Re-enable (When Ready)

### Option 1: Re-enable the startup script
```bash
# Edit startup_smart_analysis.sh
# Uncomment lines 15-28
# Comment out lines 11-13
```

### Option 2: Re-enable the Python script
```bash
# Edit run_daily_smart_analysis.py
# Remove or comment out lines 58-61:
#     logger.info("Smart Analysis is DISABLED to conserve trial API calls")
#     logger.info("To enable automated analysis, remove this safety check")
#     return
```

## Manual Smart Analysis (Still Available)

You can still run Smart Analysis manually when needed:

```bash
# For specific user
python manage.py smartanalyse user1

# For all users
python manage.py smartanalyse --all

# Dry run (no changes)
python manage.py smartanalyse --all --dry-run
```

## API Usage

With automated analysis disabled, you'll only use API calls when:
- Manually running Smart Analysis commands
- User-initiated analysis from the web interface
- Testing and development

This should significantly reduce your trial API usage! ðŸŽ¯
